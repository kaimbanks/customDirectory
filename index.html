The low f-stop allows for a very shallow depth of field, and the 50mm fixed focus is perfect for most close to mid-range applications. A ton of amateur videos on YouTube and elsewhere employ this lens, as it has a very smooth focus operation and captures the perfect field of view for a ton of situations. This is a must-have, and it's cheap.</td>

It does produce a slight fish-eye effect, as with most wide-angle lenses, but this can easily be corrected with lens profiles in LightRoom or PhotoShop. There are wide-angle options out there that do not produce a similar effect, but this one is less than a third the price of the nearest competitor made by Nikon. This lens is also popular with wide-angle videographers becuase of its crystal-clear glass and extremely smooth manual focus. Be warned: there is no autofocus for this lens on Nikon camera bodies.</td>

Great for pretty much everything - and a solid investment if you're still trying to figure out what type of photography you like best. The 18mm focal length allows for the lowest f-stop, while the 55mm length most nearly reflects an average person's field of view. You likely won't end up using this lens for professional productions, but it's great for figuring out what focal length you like most.</td>

It does not produce a measurable fish-eye effect, which is unusual for a lens with such a short focal distance. This is an ideal lens for macrophotography (flowers, insects, etc). Its short focal length also allows for an extremely quick auto-focus, so if you're planning on shooting fast-moving insects up close for example, choose the 35mm over the 50mm.</td>

Give it a shot if you have some cash to spare, but be aware: this lens is not great for anything past 20 or so feet, as it's a non-zoomable close-focus prime lens. Carry this around if you want a good option that sits between a 14mm and 35mm lens.

The low f-stop contributes to incredibly crisp shots, and the zoom capabilities are fantastic. It's an incredibly flexible lens, and will last the whole life of your camera. If you can afford it, get one of these instead of the Rokinon 14mm prime and Nikon 24mm prime. Its fisheye effect is limited, and the glass that comprises the lenses is extremely well-manufactured. </td>

Whether you're shooting birds, giraffes, lions, pool sports, or other distant events, this lens constantly rewards with ultra-crisp, low-distortion shots, even at high ISO values. It's not super fast, so you won't get a lot of bokeh, but it's the best lens past the 300mm mark. When you see footage of shy/hard-to-find animals on National Geographic and similar programs, those photos are more often than not captured with this particular lens when the photographer uses a Nikon body.</td>

Excellent for those shoots where you don't want to get too close to your subject, but still want super-crisp close-up face shots (weddings!). It has an incredibly low f-stop for its long focal length, which allows for shallow depths of field even at significant distances. This is one of the most popular lenses for wildlife photography situations in which the photographer is concealed in some manner and is thus able to reduce his or her distance to the wildlife of interest.</td>

The glass clarity isn't quite as good as the more expensive Nikkor lenses, and the high f-stop isn't ideal, but there's a lot of value in being able to shoot in the 70-300mm range.
